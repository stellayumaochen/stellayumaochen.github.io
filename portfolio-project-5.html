                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Data Analytics as a Service (DAaaS) is a project aimed at improving data accessibility and collaboration, making it faster to deliver insights, and strengthening analytical and research capabilities. This initiative bridges the gap between data users and providers, facilitating greater collaboration and partnerships.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>User Journey</h3>
                    <p>Aligned with the user journey, the project comprises 10 distinct initiatives.These initiatives tailored to various user personas, including data researchers, data engineers, data scientists, data analysts, as well as secondary personas like journalists, students, and data librarians.</p>

                    <p>Upon joining the project, it was already in the discovery phase. The team had completed the first round of user interviews and created detailed personas. A well-defined workflow was established, guiding our subsequent actions.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>User Interview</h3>
                    <p>In my role, I was responsible for the account management initiative. My initial tasks involved transcribing user interviews. Despite my limited prior experience in the data sector, this process helped me quickly grasp our users' daily challenges. Regular team meetings were instrumental in understanding the scope of the account management initiative.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Observations and Findings</h4>
                    <p>We continually refined the interview protocol, adjusted the flow and questions, and conducted a second round of user interviews. During this phase, my primary focus was on transcribing, data analysis, identifying user needs related to account management, and proposing potential solutions. Our team shared key findings at weekly touchpoint meetings, summarizing standout insights for designers.</p>

                    <h3>Journey Map</h3>
                    <p>The team had already created journey maps for account management, including external/internal user access to confidential data, Public Use Microdata Files (PUMFs), and Real-Time Remote Analysis (RTRA). As we gathered more user insights, we recognized the need to update these maps. I collaborated with another researcher to incorporate new discoveries, ensuring the maps were comprehensive and accurate.</p>

                    <h4>Collaboration way in the User Journey</h4>
                    <p>In parallel with updating the journey maps, our team reconsidered how users collaborate at each phase of their data journey. We reorganized the entire user journey, from dataset discovery to sharing and exporting files</p>

                    <h3>ECCC Workshop</h3>
                    <p>Our team conducted a workshop with energy data users at the offices of Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). My role involved note-taking, data collection during the workshop, which were later extracted to derive key findings.</p>

                    <h4>What Works Well and What Does Not</h4>
                    <p>In one activity, participants reflected on their data journey, noting both positive and negative experiences. They shared their thoughts behind each note, fostering deeper insights.</p>

                    <h4>Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN) & Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)</h4>
                    <p>After the workshop, we integrated the data gathered from both the ECCC and the previous NRCAN workshops to uncover shared themes pertaining to StatsCan's data.</p>

                    <h3>Mockups</h3>
                    <p>In addition to user research, I assisted the design team by creating mockups. One notable mockup was the content results page, which underwent revisions based on insights from user workshops.</p>

                    <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                    <p>Our interdisciplinary team, including researchers, designers, and developers, held weekly roundtable meetings to align our work. Designers provided mockups for usability testing, and I compiled insights for the landing page. These insights informed recommendations for designers to refine the mockups.</p>
